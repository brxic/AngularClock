# AngularClock
A Clock to watch the time made with Angular and Local Date/Time so no server needed.

### Usage
I added the Clock to the app.component.html and to style it I used Tailwind CSS

```html
  <div class="absolute top-10 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 z-20">
    <app-clock></app-clock>
  </div>
```
